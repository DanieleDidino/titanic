Titanic dataset (Kaggle)

This is an example of applying pipelines on multiple models with different parameters grids.
I used a list with estimators and parameter grids to perform grid search (GridSearchCV) on three models (SGDClassifier, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest). And also a Voting classifier.

Score: 0.78708
